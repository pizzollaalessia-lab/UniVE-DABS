# HEALTH DATA SCIENCE  
In this project, we aim to explore the potential association between psychological health and the development of physical illnesses. In particular, we focused on cancer, investigating whether certain patterns in mental health could be linked to an increased risk of developing tumors.  
**Abstract**  
This study investigates the complex relationship between psychological well-being and the onset of physical illnesses, with a particular focus on cancer. The primary aim is to explore whether specific patterns of mental health distress are associated with an increased risk of tumor development.  
To address this, we conducted an exploratory data analysis and employed contingency tables to identify preliminary associations between psychological and physical health indicators. Statistical models—including logistic regression, generalized linear mixed models (GLMM), Poisson and binomial regressions—were applied to quantify risk and control for potential confounding variables.  
Furthermore, we examined the reverse relationship, assessing how psychological health may be influenced by physical conditions and socio-demographic factors, using ordered regression models.  
The findings suggest a bidirectional link between mental and physical health, highlighting the importance of integrated approaches in both the prevention and treatment of oncological diseases.
